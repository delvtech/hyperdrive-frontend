These terms of service, together with any documents and additional terms they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "Terms"), are entered into between Element Finance, Inc. ("Element," "we," "us" and "our") and you or the company or other legal entity you represent ("you" or "your"), and constitute a binding legal agreement.

Please read these Terms carefully, as these Terms govern your use of our platform and our services, and expressly cover your rights and obligations, and our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability, relating to such use. By accessing or using the platform or the services, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by and to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are prohibited from accessing or using the platform or the services.

You acknowledge and agree that, as provided in greater detail in these Terms: (i) the platform and the services are licensed, not sold to you, and you may use the platform and the services only as set forth in these Terms; and (ii) the platform and the services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind and our liability to you is limited.

Please note that Section 14 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree (a) to resolve all disputes with us through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and (b) that you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions. You have the right to opt-out of arbitration as explained in Section 14.

You must be able to form a legally binding contract online either on behalf of a company or as an individual. Accordingly, you represent that: (a) if you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you have the legal authority to bind the company or other legal entity to these Terms; and (b) you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you reside, whichever is older), can form a legally binding contract online, and have the full, right, power, and authority to enter into and to comply with the obligations under these Terms.

In addition to the foregoing, you also represent and warrant that you are not a citizen or resident of a state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction that is embargoed by the United States, European Union or its Member States, United Kingdom, United Nations, or any other country or region where your use of or access to the platform or the services would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law. Specifically, you represent that you are not located in, organized in, or a resident of Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, the Crimea region, Donetsk People's Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, or any other jurisdiction where applicable law prohibits you from accessing or using the services (collectively, "Sanctioned Country"); and you represent that you are not named on, owned, controlled by or acting on behalf of any party named on any sanctions-related list of designated persons maintained by the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, United Nations, or other governmental authority (collectively, "Sanctioned Persons").

Element is not affiliated with and has no control over these third-party protocols and is not responsible for any losses that occur as a result of interconnection with these third-party protocols. The protocol is open-source software deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. While Element developed and deployed the protocol, the software operates in an autonomous fashion on a decentralized network and, as a result, Element has no control over user transactions.

## 11. DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS

Element is a developer of open-source software. Element does not operate a digital asset
exchange platform or execute peer-to-peer transactions through its Protocol and therefore has no
oversight, involvement, or control with respect to your transactions, which are executed through
third-party protocols and the Ethereum Blockchain. The Protocol is an autonomous decentralized
web protocol deployed to the Ethereum Blockchain that operates in a disintermediated fashion,
and, as such, Element does not participate in any of these transactions. In each instance, when
you interact with the Protocol, you are interacting with a smart contract that deploys your digital
assets to a third-party protocol.


You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your
transactions, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and
the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or other regulatory agencies in the U.S. or other jurisdictions.

You understand that Element is not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or any financial regulatory authority. No financial
regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Platform or the Services. The
Platform, the Services and Tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or
regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of Element Governance Token holders
to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Platform
or the Services, including access to your funds and Tokens. Neither the Platform nor the Services
constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any asset. Element is not acting as an
investment adviser, financial services advisor, commodity trading adviser to any person.

Element does not own or control the underlying software protocols that enable the
Protocol to function. In general, the underlying protocols are open-source software, and anyone
can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. Additionally, the underlying protocols are subject to
sudden changes in operating rules (known as “Forks”) and such Forks may materially affect the
Protocol. Element is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols, and Element
makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.

With respect to the Platform and any Services (including use of the Governance Site and
the NFT Site), smart contracts, blockchains and cryptographic systems is a new and progressing
field. These technologies and the Platform and the Services are experimental in nature and
involve some risk. There are numerous ways the Protocol, the Governance Site and/or the NFT
Site could fail unexpectedly, resulting in the total and absolute loss of all of your Tokens and/or
the casting of your vote under your Element Governance Tokens in an unintended way (or not
being cast at all). Any use or interaction with the Platform and/or the Services requires some
understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate the inherent
risks. You represent and warrant to us that you possess relevant knowledge and skills.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE
PLATFORM AND THE SERVICES (AND ANY OF THEIR CONTENT OR
FUNCTIONALITY) PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF US ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS

## 14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

#### PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES

#### YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (JURY TRIAL WAIVER) OF ANY

#### AND ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

#### CLAIMS AND SMALL CLAIMS) WITH ELEMENT AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN

#### WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ELEMENT (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS,

#### CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS).

```
a. Binding Arbitration; Disputes; Small Claims. You andElement agree to waive
any right to a jury trial, or the right to have any Dispute resolved in any court,
and instead accept the use of binding arbitration (which is the referral of a
Dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination);
provided, however, that you have the right to litigate any Dispute in small claims
court in either New Castle County, Delaware or in your county of residence, if all
the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on
jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the Dispute, are satisfied. “Dispute” as
used in this Section 14 means any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy
arising out of or in any way related to Element in connection with these Terms,
the subject matter of these Terms, or access to and use of the Platform, the
Services or other Element’s products including but not limited to contract,
personal injury, tort, warranty, statute or regulation, or other legal or equitable
basis and disputes that involve third parties, except any dispute, cause of action,
claim, or controversy relating to Element’s intellectual property (such as
trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and/or patents).
You and Element empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve
any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these
Terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any Dispute and
any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable.
```
```
b. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. You and
Element agree that any Dispute is personal to you and Element, and that any
Dispute shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration and shall not be
brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative
proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration, or an arbitration where a
person brings a Dispute as a representative of any other person or persons.
Neither you nor Element agree that a Dispute can be brought as a class or
representative action whether inside or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any
other person or persons.
```
```
c. Federal Arbitration Act. You and Element agree thatthese Terms affect interstate
commerce and that the enforceability of Section 14 shall be governed by,
```

```
construed, and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ("FAA") to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law.
```
d. Confidentiality. The arbitrator, Element, and youshall maintain the
confidentiality of any proceedings, including but not limited to, any and all
information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or
related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator shall have the authority to make
appropriate rulings to safeguard that confidentiality, unless the law provides to
the contrary.

e. Process. Our goal is to resolve claims fairly andquickly. Accordingly, for any
Dispute that you have against Element, you agree to first contact Element and
attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim
("Notice") to Element. The Notice to Element must be sent either by email at
legal@element.fior by certified mail addressed toElement Finance, Inc., Attn:
Privacy, 8528 Davis Blvd, #134-262, North Richland Hills, Texas. The Notice
must (a) include your name, residence address, and email address and/or mobile
telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth
the specific relief sought. If you and Element cannot reach an agreement to
resolve the claim within 30 days after such Notice is received, then either party
may, as appropriate in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration
proceeding or file a claim in court. You and Element agree that any Dispute must
be commenced or filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the
Dispute is permanently barred.

```
In the event that you and Element cannot resolve a Dispute and you do not
pursue your claims through small claims court, you or Element shall promptly
submit the Dispute to binding arbitration at the office of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). In the event AAA declines or is unable to
administer the arbitration, you and Element agree to use an arbitration forum or
arbitrator that you and Element mutually agree upon. If, after making a
reasonable effort, you and Element are not able to agree upon an arbitration
forum or arbitrator, AAA or a court having proper jurisdiction will appoint an
arbitration forum or arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance
with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") then in effect. The
AAA Rules and other information about AAA and arbitration are readily
available at https://www.adr.org, by calling 1-800-778-7879,or by mail at 120
Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271. By entering into these Terms, you
either (1) acknowledge that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or (2)
waive reading the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are
unfair in any way. You and Element agree that these Terms govern the
arbitration, and that the applicable AAA Rules shall be subject to changes in
procedures that AAA may make from time to time.
```
```
As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the applicable AAA Rules, the
arbitrator will have the exclusive power and jurisdiction to make all procedural
```

```
and substantive decisions concerning the Dispute; provided, however, that this
power does not include the power to conduct a class arbitration or a
representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms (as stated above). The
arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration, and may not consolidate
more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of
representative or class proceeding, or any proceeding on behalf of or involving
more than one person or persons.
```
```
Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an
improper purpose, Element will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and
expenses, except that you will pay the filing fee for any arbitration you initiate.
Element waives any right to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in
connection with any non-frivolous arbitration between you and us.
```
```
f. Right to Opt Out. You may opt out of this agreementto arbitrate. If you do so,
neither you nor Element can require the other to participate in an arbitration
proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date
that you first became subject to this arbitration provision, and must include your
name, residence address, and email address, and a clear statement that you want
to opt out of this arbitration agreement. Any requests to opt out must be sent
either by email atlegal@element.fior by certifiedmail addressed to Element
Finance, Inc., Attn: Privacy, 8528 Davis Blvd, #134-262, North Richland Hills,
Texas.
```
```
If a court or arbitrator decides that any of this section's limitations cannot be
enforced as to a particular claim for relief or request for a remedy (such as public
injunctive relief), then that claim or request for a remedy (and only that claim or
request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
Unless you choose to opt out, this dispute resolution provision in Section 14 shall
survive termination of these Terms.
```
## 15. GOVERNING LAW

The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these
Terms, the Platform or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, as applicable, without regard to conflict of
law rules or principles (whether of the state of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. With respect to any proceeding that is
not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in Delaware, will
have exclusive jurisdiction, except for any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy relating
to Element’s intellectual property, which we may initiate in any court having jurisdiction. You
waive any objection to venue in any such courts.

```

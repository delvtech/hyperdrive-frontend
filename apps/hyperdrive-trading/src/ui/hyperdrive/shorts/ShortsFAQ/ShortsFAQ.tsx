        <span>
          Simply put, a short is the opposite of a long. Opening a short implies
          short-selling hy[Token] at its current market price, thus paying an
          amount equivalent to the hy[Token]&rsquo;s discount (i.e., the fixed
          rate applied to the position size) upfront, while accruing the
          variable interest (APY) on the full size of the position being shorted
          for the duration it&rsquo;s held. <br />
          <br />
          Opening a short causes the market price of hy[Token] to decrease,
          while closing a short has the inverse effect. <br />

        By opening a Long and holding it to maturity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Opening a long position in Hyperdrive implies purchasing hy[Token] at a
        discount. hy[Token] is redeemable for its full face value at maturity.
        The market price you pay and the hy[Token]&rsquo;s value at maturity are
        known upfront, which results in a fixed rate of return. <br />
        <br />
        Opening longs has an immediate impact on the market. hy[Token]&rsquo;s
        market price increases, which means the fixed rate decreases.
        Conversely, closing longs has the immediate impact of decreasing the
        market price and increasing the fixed rate. <br />

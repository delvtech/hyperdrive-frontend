          By opening a Long and holding it to maturity. <br />
          <br />
          Opening a long position in Hyperdrive implies purchasing hy[Token] at
          a discount. hy[Token] is redeemable for its full face value at
          maturity. The market price you pay and the hy[Token]&rsquo;s value at
          maturity are known upfront, which results in a fixed rate of return.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          Opening longs has an immediate impact on the market. hy[Token]&rsquo;s
          market price increases, which means the fixed rate decreases.
          Conversely, closing longs has the immediate impact of decreasing the
          market price and increasing the fixed rate. <br />

    question: "What is a short?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <span>
          Simply put, a short is the opposite of a long. Opening a short implies
          short-selling hy[Token] at its current market price, thus paying an
          amount equivalent to the hy[Token]&rsquo;s discount (i.e., the fixed
          rate applied to the position size) upfront, while accruing the
          variable interest (APY) on the full size of the position being shorted
          for the duration it&rsquo;s held. <br />
          <br />
          Opening a short causes the market price of hy[Token] to decrease,
          while closing a short has the inverse effect. <br />
          <br />
          Users can take speculative short positions or use shorts for hedging
          other investments. Read our docs to learn more about{" "}

    question: "What are the benefits of providing liquidity?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <span>
          Liquidity providers (LPs) take potential revenue from 3 different
          sources: <br /> - Trading fees from longs and shorts being opened and
          closed by traders. <br /> - Variable rate on their idle capital being
          deployed to the underlying yield source. <br /> - Profit (or loss)
          resulting from taking the other side of tradersâ€™ positions.
          <br />
          Furthermore, LP capital isn&rsquo;t tied to a specific maturity date,
          so these benefits remain until the funds are withdrawn by the LP.{" "}

          ). However, closing these positions before maturity implies selling
          them to the AMM at the current market price. In other words, positions
          that are closed early won&rsquo;t get the initially expected rate of
          return, since their exit value depends on market activity. <br />
          <br />
          Liquidity Provider (LP) positions don&rsquo;t have a maturity date, so
          LP funds can be withdrawn at any time as long as they&rsquo;re not
          currently backing other long or short positions; if they are, LPs will
          receive Withdrawal Shares that represent pending withdrawals that
          still share the same benefits of regular LP capital. Learn more in the{" "}

    question: "How do LP positions work?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        <span>
          You open an LP position by providing base asset to the AMM. This
          increases the AMM&rsquo;s capacity for longs and shorts. LP capital is
          then used to back long and short positions opened by traders.
          <br />
          <br />
          LPs can withdraw their capital at any time, but if part of it is
          currently backing open positions, the AMM will temporarily keep that
          part and give Withdrawal Shares to the LP until there is enough idle
          liquidity available to replace that capital. <br />
          <br />
          When long or short positions are closed, the liquidity used to back
          them is freed up and used to buy back Withdrawal Shares, at which
          point LPs can complete their pending withdrawal process. <br />

id: long
title: Open a Long

Looking for a [getting started guide](/docs/sdk/getting-started)?

## Overview
When the trader enters a long position, they are typically long on the bond price. They have purchased bonds at a discount, with a set maturity date. The lower the bond price, the higher the fixed return that the trader is getting, because theyâ€™re paying less money now for more base asset at maturity. By buying bonds, they bring the bond price up and the fixed rate down.

## TODO:
- import fake pulic client and wallet client so users know where things come from.
- make id also optional
- have a destructured return value
- have a couple usage examples
 - have another that uses the onSubmitted
 - this method will wait for the transaction to be mined before returning

## Usage

```tsx {14}
import { ViemReadWriteHyperdrive } from '@hyperdrive/sdk-viem'

// Create Hyperdrive SDK instance using Viem
export const hyperdrive = new ViemReadWriteHyperdrive({
    address: HYPERDRIVE_ADDRESS,
    mathAddress: HYPERDRIVE_MATH_ADDRESS,
    publicClient,
    walletClient,
    cache: querySdkCache, // optional
    id: chainId.toString(),
});
// note that you may want/need to handle this async code differently,
// for example if top-level await is not an option
const {} = await hyperdrive.openLong({baseAmount, bondAmountOut, destination});
```

id: long
title: Open a Long
---
Looking for a [getting started guide](/docs/sdk/getting-started)?

## Overview
When the trader enters a long position, they are typically long on the bond price. They have purchased bonds at a discount, with a set maturity date. The lower the bond price, the higher the fixed return that the trader is getting, because theyâ€™re paying less money now for more base asset at maturity. By buying bonds, they bring the bond price up and the fixed rate down.

## Usage

```tsx {16}
import { ViemReadWriteHyperdrive } from '@hyperdrive/sdk-viem'
import { publicClient, walletClient } from '../clients'
import { HYPERDRIVE_ADDRESS, HYPERDRIVE_MATH_ADDRESS } from '../constants'
import { querySdkCache } from '../cache'
import { chainId } from '../chainId'

// Create Hyperdrive SDK instance using Viem
export const hyperdrive = new ViemReadWriteHyperdrive({
    address: HYPERDRIVE_ADDRESS,
    mathAddress: HYPERDRIVE_MATH_ADDRESS,
    publicClient,
    walletClient,
    cache: querySdkCache, // optional
    id: chainId.toString(),
});
// note that you may want/need to handle this async code differently,
// for example if top-level await is not an option
const { maturityTime, bondProceeds } = await hyperdrive.openLong({baseAmount, bondAmountOut, destination});

// openLong can also be called with ContractWriteOptions that allows you to specify a callback for when the transaction is submitted
// a custom cache can also be passed in
await hyperdrive.openLong({
    baseAmount,
    bondAmountOut,
    destination,
    chache: customSdkCache,
    id: chainId.toString(),
    options: {
        onSubmitted: (txHash) => {
            console.log(`txHash: ${txHash}`)
        }
}});

```

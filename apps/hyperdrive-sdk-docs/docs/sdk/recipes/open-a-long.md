title: Open a Long
---

## Overview

When the trader enters a long position, they are typically long on the bond price. They have purchased bonds at a discount, with a set maturity date. The lower the bond price, the higher the fixed return that the trader is getting, because theyâ€™re paying less money now for more base asset at maturity. By buying bonds, they bring the bond price up and the fixed rate down.

## Usage

### Create Hyperdrive SDK instance using Viem

```tsx {18}
import { ViemReadWriteHyperdrive } from "@delvtech/hyperdrive-viem";
import { publicClient, walletClient } from "./clients";

export const hyperdrive = new ViemReadWriteHyperdrive({
  address: `0x...`,
  mathAddress: `0x...`,
  publicClient,
  walletClient,
});
```

### Open a long, wait for the tx to be mined, then grab the result

```tsx
const { maturityTime, bondProceeds } = await hyperdrive.openLong({
  baseAmount,
  bondAmountOut,
  destination,
});
```

### Open a long and grab the submitted txHash

openLong can also be called with [ContractWriteOptions](/docs/sdk/api-reference/interfaces/ContractWriteOptionsWithCallback) that allows you to specify a callback for when the transaction is submitted. A custom cache can also be passed in.

```ts
await hyperdrive.openLong({
  baseAmount,
  bondAmountOut,
  destination,
  chache: customSdkCache,
  id: chainId.toString(),
  options: {
    onSubmitted: (txHash) => {
      console.log(`txHash: ${txHash}`);
    },
  },
});
```

## hyperdrive-frontend-monorepo

A TypeScript monorepo containing apps and packages for integrating and
interacting with Hyperdrive.

Powered by [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build).

## What is inside?

Apps

- [hyperdrive-trading](apps/hyperdrive-trading/) - A simple frontend for interacting with Hyperdrive
- [hyperdrive-sdk-docs](apps/hyperdrive-sdk-docs/) - Docs site for the Hyperdrive SDK

Packages

- [@delvtech/hyperdrive-js-core](packages/hyperdrive-js-core/) - Hyperdrive SDK core logic
- [@delvtech/hyperdrive-viem](packages/hyperdrive-viem/) - Viem bindings for `@delvtech/hyperdrive-js-core`
- [@delvtech/hyperdrive-artifacts](packages/hyperdrive-artifacts/) - ABIs and bytecode for Hyperdrive contracts
- [@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm](packages/hyperdrive-artifacts/) - Wasm bindings for the [Hyperdrive Rust SDK](https://github.com/delvtech/hyperdrive-rs)
- [@hyperdrive/appconfig](packages/hyperdrive-appconfig/) - Hyperdrive static metadata by chain (eg: poolConfig, name, symbol, decimal, etc.)

### Installation

Install dependencies and build packages.

**Note:** The following two commands must be run from the **root directory** of the
monorepo before interacting with any apps or packages.

```bash
yarn
yarn run build:packages
```

> To use the local version of `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm` in the other packages instead of installing it from NPM, it must be built before dependencies are installed. To ensure this happens, a `preinstall` script is included in the root `package.json` that runs `yarn build:crates`.

### Environment variables

Some projects in this monorepo require environment variables. Make sure to
create a `.env` file according to the project's `.env.sample` when building or
doing development.

### Where to now?

Check out the list of [apps and packages](#what-is-inside) above.

### Creating a release

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage
versioning and changelogs. This means you shouldn't need to manually change of
the internal package versions. (excluding the `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm` package. See below)

Before opening a PR, run `yarn changeset` and follow the prompts to describe the
changes you've made. This will create a changeset file that should be committed.

As changesets are committed to the `main` branch, the [changesets github
action](https://github.com/changesets/action) in the release workflow will
automatically keep track of the pending `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
updates in an open PR titled `chore: version packages`.

Once this PR is merged, the release workflow will be triggered, creating new
tags and github releases, and publishing the updated packages to NPM. **These
PRs should be carefully reviewed!**

#### Updating `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm`

The `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm` package is a bit special because it contains a
pre-built wasm binary. This binary is built using the `wasm-pack` tool, and the
resulting package is published to NPM. This means that the version of the
`@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm` package in the `package.json` files of the other
packages must be updated manually.

To create a new release of `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm`:

1. Update the version in the `Cargo.toml` file of the `hyperdrive-wasm` crate and commit the change.
   
2. Add a new tag for the version with the format `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm@vX.Y.Z` (eg: `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm@v0.1.0`).
   ```sh
    git tag @delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm@vX.Y.Z
    ```

3. Push the tag to the repository.
   ```sh
    git push --tags
    ```

4. Create a new release on the GitHub repository from the tag. This will trigger the GitHub action to publish the new version to NPM.
   
5. Update the version of `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm` in the `package.json` files of the other packages to the new version.
   
6. Follow the steps above to create a new releases for the other packages with changesets.

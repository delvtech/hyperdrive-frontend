### Installation

Install dependencies and build packages.

**Note:** The following two commands must be run from the **root directory** of the
monorepo before interacting with any apps or packages.

```bash
yarn
yarn run build:packages
```

If you're working on the `@delvtech/hyperdrive-wasm` package, you will need to
have the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain and
[Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installatio://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation)
installed to compile it. You can install it by running:

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Install Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

Then, run the following command from the root directory of the monorepo:

```bash
yarn run build:crates
```

### Environment variables

Some projects in this monorepo require environment variables. Make sure to
create a `.env` file according to the project's `.env.sample` when building or
doing development.

### Where to now?

Check out the list of [apps and packages](#what-is-inside) above.

### Creating a release

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage
versioning and changelogs. This means you shouldn't need to manually change of
the internal package versions.

Before opening a PR, run `yarn changeset` and follow the prompts to describe the
changes you've made. This will create a changeset file that should be committed.

As changesets are committed to the `main` branch, the [changesets github
action](https://github.com/changesets/action) in the release workflow will
automatically keep track of the pending `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
updates in an open PR titled `chore: version packages`.

Once this PR is merged, the release workflow will be triggered, creating new
tags and github releases, and publishing the updated packages to NPM. **These
PRs should be carefully reviewed!**
